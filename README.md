## About CuteDancer

CuteDancer is a unitypackage dedicated for VRChat avatars. It contains dance animations that can be played in sync together with other players who has the package installed on their avatars.

### How does it work?

It uses new contacts components added reccently to VRChat. When one avatar starts dancing, the sender component is activated and receivers on others avatars plays animation as well. It is possible to disable receivers if needed.

### Included dances

At the moment package contains 3 dances:
- SAR Dance - default dance from Super Animal Royale game
- Coincidance - shoulder shake dance meme
- Badger badger - simple badger dance

All above dance animations are created from scratch by Krysiek using [Cascadeur](https://cascadeur.com/).  
I created them on Taidum model, but they will work on all other avatars.

Example controllers are: Ctrl_Action_Example and Ctrl_FX_Example.

You can transfer layers manually by selecting all blocks and using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V or you can use an automatic script included in the package.

üõë **REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR ACTION AND FX CONTROLLERS BEFORE USING THE SCRIPT** üõë

Select from top menu: Tools -> CuteDancer Setup

In first field select Action controller used by your avatar.
In second field select FX controller used by your avatar.

You can drag&drop them from assets.

Click: Add layers to my avatar.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: If you would want to remove layers later - don't change CuteDance's layer names in your controllers! ‚ö†Ô∏è
