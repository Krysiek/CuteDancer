## About CuteDancer

CuteDancer is a .unitypackage dedicated to use on [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/) avatars. It contains dance animations that can be played in sync together with other players who have the package installed on their avatars. [You can try it on public avatars here.](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_deb6ff93-c907-4d16-92d0-911758135c70)

### How does it work?

It uses new contacts components added recently to VRChat. When one avatar starts dancing, the sender component is activated and receivers on other avatars play that animation as well. It is possible to disable contacts if needed.

### Included dances

At the moment the package contains 4 dances:
- SAR Dance - default dance from [Super Animal Royale](https://animalroyale.com/) game
- Coincidance - shoulder shake meme dance
- Badger badger - simple badger dance
- Zufolo Impazzito - dance based on [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/doodoofard/comments/w6lhnl/dance/)

All above dance animations were created from scratch by [Krysiek](https://github.com/Krysiek) using [Cascadeur](https://cascadeur.com/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).  
I created them on Taidum model, but they will work on all other avatars.
