# CuteDancer v4.0

Before install, remove directory of any older version of CuteDancer from Assets.

### Completely rewritten setup script

- New dances browser allows you to select animations wherever you like! You can enable or disable music for any of them.
- Building CuteDancer animator, prefabs, params etc. is now separated of applying them to the avatar. After the build you can chose another tool to apply ready files to your avatar.

### Custom animations support

- Now you can add your own animations in easy way! Just follow attached template, edit json file, put animation, animator, icon and music in the directory and your new dance is ready.

### VRChat Creator Companion Support

- Support for VPM repository listing and auto-updates, yay!

### Other

- Optimized receivers setup. Now your avatar will have only one multi receiver active and activates other only when another avatar start dancing. This should not affect performance when not used, so you can walk with CuteDancer enabled without concern about performance.
- Disabled Loop time on single frame animations (optimization)
